    description: "The Audi SQ2 is the high-performance variant of Audi's smallest SUV. Based on the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, it features a turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder engine producing 295 HP and 400 Nm of torque, shared with other compact performance models like the Audi S3 and Volkswagen Golf R. Power is delivered to all four wheels via a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system. Performance is impressive for a compact SUV, with 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) acceleration in 4.8 seconds. The exterior features more aggressive styling with S-specific bumpers, larger air intakes, quad exhaust tips, and unique 18 or 19-inch wheels. The suspension is lowered by 20mm compared to the standard Q2, and the interior features sport seats, stainless steel pedals, and S-specific displays."
